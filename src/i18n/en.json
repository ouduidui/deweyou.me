  "lineThree": "Currently the commonly used technology frameworks are React + Typescript, while I personally prefer Vue3. Anyway, these are just development tools. What's more important is how we can use these tools more efficiently to achieve our products.",
  "lineFour": "Usually, I prefer to focus on product design and interactive experience. I believe that they are equally important as the functions provided by the product. Frontend work is the work most closely related to users, and serves as a bridge between users and products. This is one of the reasons why I chose to specialize in frontend work. Before I started on the frontend, I also studied graphic design and video editing, which is also closely related to user experience.",
  "lineFive": "Besides work, I also enjoy taking photos, playing Rubik's Cube, practicing the piano, reading books, and so on. I am a curious person, so I will spend some time exploring things that interest me.",
